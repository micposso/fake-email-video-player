Current support of HTML5 video in email:

Apple mail - SUPPORTED

Outlook.com - SUPPORTED

Android 4.5+ - SUPPORTED

Email clients that do not support HTML5 video and possible fall back alternatives:

iOS 9 - NOT SUPPORTED - FAKE VIDEO PLAYER FALLBACK

Outlook - NOT SUPPORTED - STATIC IMAGE FALL BACK

Gmail app - NOT SUPPORTED - ANIMATED GIF FALLBACK

yahooo - NOT SUPPORTED - ANIMATED GIF FALLBACK

AOL - NOT SUPPORTED - ANIMATED GIF FALLBACK

NOTE: Since this is an animated GIF, is recomended to keep the fize size to less than 2mg for optimal download time. In 4gLTE, a 2mg file downloads in 3 seconds depending on connection speed.
